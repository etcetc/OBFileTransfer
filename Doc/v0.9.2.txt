RELEASE NOTES 0.9.2
===================


BUG - Time too skewed for S3 requests that retry 15 minutes or more after they were first created.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
Amazon SDK can't handle some cases with RequestClockTooSkewed because it uses current clock offset for calculating new offset too.

SOLUTION:
Do not use persistence for offset.
