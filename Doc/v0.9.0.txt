RELEASE NOTES 0.9.0
===================


BUG - Time too skewed for S3 requests that retry 15 minutes or more after they were first created.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROBLEM:
When we create the S3 Request for download we would put a timestamp in the header. When this request is retried eventually the timestamp becomes stale relative to the current time on the S3 server and we get TimeTooSkewed error from S3

SOLUTION:
Create download requests using AWS pre-signed URL with a lifetime timestamp that is longer than 15 minutes. We have set this to 1 week.


PROBLEM:
If device clock is set to wrong time we will get a TimeTooSkewed error for downloads and uploads.

SOLUTION:
In case of timeTooSkeweed error:
  - Adjust runtimeClockSkew in AWS sdk using the difference between local clock and time reported by the server in the error.
  - Persist this runtimeClockSkew in user defaults
  - Update AwsSdk runtimeClockSkew from persisted value before creating any new requests
  - Retry the request
