Created a repo for Private-Cocoapods
------------------------------------
- This is a repo for podspecs for our own private cocoapods. That way we can use modules that might not pass muster on the 
  cocoapod master repo.
- It is on github as noplanb/Private-Cocoapods
- I pushed the podspecs for both OBFileTransfer and OBLogger to this repo


To Use
------
- Get cocoapods
  - Install cocoapod gem see website for instructions works under ruby 1.9.3 I have found problems with older ruby.

- Let cocoapods know about our Private-Cocoapods
  - That way it will look there as well as in the master repo for a podspec you require.
  $ pod repo add Private-Cocoapods git@github.com:noplanb/Private-Cocoapods.git
  
- Add OBFileTransfer to a project you are working on.
  - In the top level directory for your project add a file 'Podfile' if you dont have one.
  - Add the line
    - pod 'OBFileTransfer'
  - In the same directory 
    $ pod install
  - This should bring in all the neccessary files, dependencies frameworks etc.
  - After you do pod install you should use the workspace file to start xcode rather than the project file.

Release Checklist
-----------------
- Test the example app
- Create a file vn.n.n.txt with the release notes
- Update podspec with the version
- Change the version in the podspec file
- lint to make sure ok
    $ rvm 1.9.3
    $ pod lib lint
	
- Push changes to the noplanb/FileTransferPlay repo and tag it with the same version as in the podspec file
  $ git add -A && git commit -m "Release 0.0.2."
  $ git tag '0.0.2'
  $ git push --tags
  
- Lint to make sure repo is corect
  $ pod spec lint
  
- Push the updated podspec to our Private-Cocoapods repo
  $ rvm 1.9.3
  $ pod repo push Private-Cocoapods OBFileTransfer.podspec
  
- Pod install should now pull in the newer version unless you specify and older version in the podfile.
